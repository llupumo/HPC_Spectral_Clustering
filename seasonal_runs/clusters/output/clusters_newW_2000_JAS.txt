Cutting the trajectories that we don't want
Number of points inside the polygons:
105846
Finally finished generating interpolator!
(1419,) trajectories have been removed because they were too close to land or ending up too close to land
Computing eigenvalues of the diagonalized matrix
(0,) trajectories have been removed because they were not similar to any other trajectories
The percentage of spercified elements is 0.0
Computing first 100 eigenvalues
