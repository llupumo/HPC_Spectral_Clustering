Cutting the trajectories that we don't want
Number of points inside the polygons:
125384
Finally finished generating interpolator!
(1560,) trajectories have been removed because they were too close to land or ending up too close to land
Sparsification distance: 
10000
No sparsification
(0,) trajectories have been removed because they were not similar to any other trajectories
Computing first 100 eigenvalues
